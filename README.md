# NodeProjectProduction
This repository contains an example of a simple, production-friendly Node.js application that uses Express for an HTTP server, Prisma as an ORM for accessing a PostgreSQL database, and Docker / Docker Compose for local development and deployment.  Goal: a quick start template for CRUD applications with a modern stack.
